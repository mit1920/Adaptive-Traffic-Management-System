Adaptive Traffic Management System

Overview
The Adaptive Traffic Management System (ATMS) is an intelligent traffic control solution that leverages AI/ML techniques to dynamically manage traffic signals based on real-time conditions. The system aims to reduce congestion, improve traffic flow, and minimize environmental impacts such as fuel consumption and emissions.

Features
Real-Time Traffic Monitoring: Continuously monitors traffic flow using sensors or camera feeds.
Dynamic Signal Control: Adjusts traffic signals based on vehicle density and road conditions.

Project Objectives
To minimize traffic congestion by optimizing signal timings.
To reduce travel time and improve road safety.
To provide real-time traffic analysis for urban planners.
To incorporate sustainability by reducing fuel consumption and emissions.

Technology Stack
Programming Language: Python
Deployment: streamlit
